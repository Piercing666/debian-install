# Debian-install
Install as a headless system, no DE at all
Install your GRUB though.

This script will install Gnome-core and the apps I use as well as drivers and fonts, no bloat. 
 
### To install:

```
sudo apt update

sudo apt install git

git clone https://github.com/Piercing666/debian-install

cd debian-install

chmod u+x stable.sh

chmod u+x testing.sh

sudo su

./stable.sh
or
./testing.sh


```
